Authentication ->
need for it? To avoid sending username pass at every request, authentication is done and
a token is given back to local system.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Few concepts to know ->
1. hashing : 
 1 way
 username pass is sent to be server which hash it and sent to db to hold, cant be dehashed back.

2. encryption : 
 2 way
 username pass is sent to be server which encrypt it and send to db , and if we have the required pass
 we can decrypt it back to passord.

3. jwt -> json web token
 json object is converted to jwt using a key. now if u have the key u can verify it and also convert 
 it back to object.

Visiblity ->
Hashed data hides the original data completely.
Encrypted data reveals the existence of data but hides its contents without the decryption key.
both hash data and encrypted data are visible but uska karega kya bro.

jwt are completely visible and used by anyone, key used in jwt are only for verifying it.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Now understand the process ->

browser send username pass to be server
server hashes the pass and send username and hasked pass to db
db returns a token to be server 
server returns a jwt to browser to hold in its local storage

now that jwt is the symbol of that usernam pass,
everytime u send a req, header has that jwt with it, be server gets both...
be gets that it is me sending it a request and responds back to me

now why not encryption here?
cause it saves db call evrytime to match encrypted pass.
