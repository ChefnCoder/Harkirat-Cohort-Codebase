------------------ CLASS 3.2 | FETCH API, AUTHENTICATION, DATABSES ---------

Till now we used postman to send api request to server, but in real world that doesnt work.
So in this part we are seeing if we have an api already, how to fetch information from it and display in 
out frontend.

What we did here?
html has button , when that button is clicked a function gets called, 
that function need to fetch information and then display it.

    function getAnimals() {
    console.log(fetch("https://fakerapi.it/api/v1/persons"))
    /*run it, a pending promise comes in console, thats becuase our fetch function is a async function,
    and it was still getting fetched when we consoled it out, solutio -> using promise or async await*/
